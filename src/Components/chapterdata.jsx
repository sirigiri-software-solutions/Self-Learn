About 95% contribution to the political parties comes from the rich. This gives them opportunity to express their opinions and concerns, which is not available to most citizens.

            "(ii) Teacher, doctor, vegetable vendor, lawyer \nOdd one out: Vegetable vendor. \nReason: The first three are professional occupations requiring formal education, while a vegetable vendor does not necessarily need formal training.",

            "(iii) Postman, cobbler, soldier, police constable \nOdd one out: Cobbler. \nReason: The postman, soldier, and police constable are part of government services, whereas a cobbler may work independently.",

            "(iv) MTNL, Indian Railways, Air India, Jet Airways, All India Radio \nOdd one out: Jet Airways. \nReason: Jet Airways is a private airline, while the others are public sector enterprises.",

            "6. Do you think the classification of economic activities into primary, secondary and tertiary is useful? Explain how. \nYes, this classification is useful as it helps in understanding the structure of an economy, guiding policymakers in resource allocation, and identifying areas for growth and development. It highlights the interdependence of sectors and helps track economic progress.",

            "7. For each of the sectors that we came across in this chapter why should one focus on employment and GDP? Could there be other issues which should be examined? Discuss. \nFocusing on employment and GDP helps gauge economic health and growth potential. However, other issues like income inequality, environmental sustainability, and workers' rights should also be examined to ensure holistic development.",

            "8. Make a long list of all kinds of work that you find adults around you doing for a living. In what way can you classify them? Explain your choice. \nExamples: Teacher, doctor, farmer, engineer, plumber, shopkeeper, mechanic, artist, software developer, etc. \nClassification: \n- Primary (farming, fishing), \n- Secondary (manufacturing, construction), \n- Tertiary (services like teaching, healthcare). \nThis classification is based on the type of economic activity and its role in the economy.",

            "17. Explain the objective of implementing the NREGA 2005. \nThe objective of NREGA 2005 is to provide at least 100 days of guaranteed wage employment in a financial year to every rural household, ensuring livelihood security and improving rural infrastructure.",

            "18. Using examples from your area compare and contrast the activities and functions of private and public sectors. \nPublic sector: Operates services like public hospitals and schools, often focusing on social welfare. \nPrivate sector: Includes businesses like restaurants and shops, focusing on profit. The public sector aims for public service, while the private sector is profit-driven.",

            "21. Explain how public sector contributes to the economic development of a nation. \nThe public sector provides essential services, infrastructure development, and employment opportunities. It plays a critical role in stabilizing the economy, reducing inequalities, and supporting economic growth through strategic investments.",

            "22. The workers in the unorganised sector need protection on the following issues: wages, safety and health. Explain with examples. \nWorkers in the unorganised sector often face low wages, unsafe working conditions, and lack of health benefits. For instance, construction workers may work in hazardous environments without safety gear, exposing them to health risks.",

            "23. A study in Ahmedabad found that out of 15,00,000 workers in the city, 11,00,000 worked in the unorganised sector. The total income of the city in this year (1997-1998) was Rs 60,000 million. Out of this Rs 32,000 million was generated in the organised sector. Present this data as a table. What kind of ways should be thought of for generating more employment in the city? \n\n| Category                       | Number of Workers | Total Income (Million Rs) |\n|-------------------------------|-------------------|---------------------------|\n| Unorganised Sector            | 11,00,000         | 28,000                    |\n| Organised Sector              | 4,00,000          | 32,000                    |\n| Total                         | 15,00,000         | 60,000                    |\n\nWays to generate more employment: \n- Promote skill development programs.\n- Encourage entrepreneurship and small businesses.\n- Enhance infrastructure to attract investments."

            "1. What are the different forms of power sharing in modern democracies? Give an example of each of these. \nThe different forms of power sharing include: \n- Federalism: Power is shared between central and state governments, as seen in India. \n- Separation of Powers: Different branches of government (executive, legislative, judicial) operate independently, as in the United States. \n- Coalition Governments: Multiple parties share power in government, like in many European countries. \n- Community Government: Specific groups maintain their own governance, such as the Brussels-Capital Region in Belgium.",

            "2. State one prudential reason and one moral reason for power sharing with an example from the Indian context. \nPrudential Reason: Power sharing reduces the chances of conflict between different social groups, as seen in India's reservation system for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. \nMoral Reason: Power sharing is essential for promoting equality and justice, exemplified by the representation of minority groups in India's legislative assemblies.",

            "4. The Mayor of Merchtem, a town near Brussels in Belgium, has defended a ban on speaking French in the town’s schools. He said that the ban would help all non-Dutch speakers integrate in this Flemish town. Do you think that this measure is in keeping with the spirit of Belgium’s power sharing arrangements? Give your reasons in about 50 words. \nThis measure contradicts Belgium's spirit of power sharing, which emphasizes respect for linguistic diversity and minority rights. By banning French, it undermines inclusivity and could marginalize non-Dutch speakers, contradicting the essence of Belgium's commitment to balance power among its different communities."
