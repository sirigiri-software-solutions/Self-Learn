              "7. For each of the sectors that we came across in this chapter why should one focus on employment and GDP? Could there be other issues which should be examined?

              "10. What do you understand by disguised unemployment? Explain with an example each from the urban and rural areas. \nDisguised unemployment occurs when more people are employed than necessary for a task. \nExample (rural): In agriculture, several family members may work on a small farm when fewer would suffice. \nExample (urban): In a shop, more employees may be hired than needed, leading to some being underutilized.",

              "12. Tertiary sector is not playing any significant role in the development of the Indian economy. Do you agree? Give reasons in support of your answer. \nI disagree. The tertiary sector contributes significantly to India's GDP and employment.

              "13. Service sector in India employs two different kinds of people.

              "14. Workers are exploited in the unorganised sector. Do you agree with this view?

              "18. Using examples from your area compare and contrast the activities and functions of private and public sectors. \nPublic sector: Operates services like public hospitals and schools, often focusing on social welfare. \nPrivate sector: Includes businesses like restaurants and shops, focusing on profit. The public sector aims for public service, while the private sector is profit-driven.",
              
              "21. Explain how public sector contributes to the economic development of a nation. \nThe public sector provides essential services, infrastructure development, and employment opportunities.

              "22. The workers in the unorganised sector need protection on the following issues: wages, safety and health. Explain with examples. \nWorkers in the unorganised sector often face low wages, unsafe working conditions, and lack of health benefits.

              "2. How does money solve the problem of double coincidence of wants?

              "3. How do banks mediate between those who have surplus money and those who need money? \nBanks collect deposits from individuals with surplus money and lend it to borrowers who need funds, facilitating the flow of money in the economy and ensuring that savings are used effectively.",
              
              "4. Look at a 10 rupee note. What is written on top? Can you explain this statement? \nTypically, it states 'I promise to pay the bearer the sum of ten rupees'.

              "8. In what ways does the Reserve Bank of India supervise the functioning of banks? Why is this necessary? \nThe Reserve Bank of India regulates banks by setting monetary policy, ensuring financial stability, conducting audits, and monitoring compliance with laws.

              "6. The impact of globalisation has not been uniform. Explain this statement. \nGlobalisation has benefited some countries and sectors through increased trade and investment, while others have faced challenges such as job losses, cultural homogenization, and environmental degradation, leading to unequal development.",

Give your reasons in about 50 words. \nThis measure contradicts Belgium's spirit of power sharing, which emphasizes respect for linguistic diversity and minority rights. By banning French, it undermines inclusivity and could marginalize non-Dutch speakers, contradicting the essence of Belgium's commitment to balance power among its different communities."

How does democracy produce an accountable, responsive and legitimate government? \nDemocracy promotes accountability through regular elections, where citizens can vote out unresponsive leaders. It fosters responsiveness by requiring governments to address the needs and concerns of citizens. Legitimacy arises from the consent of the governed, as elected representatives derive authority from popular support.",

What are the conditions under which democracies accommodate social diversities? \nDemocracies can accommodate social diversities when they have: \n- Inclusive political processes that allow for representation of various groups. \n- Strong legal frameworks that protect minority rights. \n- Open dialogue and negotiation among different social groups. \n- A commitment to equality and justice.",
